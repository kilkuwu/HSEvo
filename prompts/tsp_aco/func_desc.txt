The `heuristics` function is a crucial component of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It takes as input a distance matrix (2D list of floats representing distances between cities) and returns heuristic values that guide ants in making probabilistic decisions when constructing tours. The function should return a 2D list of the same dimensions as the input, where heuristic[i][j] represents the desirability of moving from city i to city j. Higher values indicate more attractive edges that ants are more likely to choose. In the ACO algorithm, the probability of selecting an edge is proportional to: (pheromone[i][j]^α) * (heuristic[i][j]^β), where α and β are parameters controlling the relative importance of pheromone trails vs heuristic information. The most common heuristic is the inverse of distance (1/distance), but more sophisticated approaches can consider multiple factors to better guide the search toward high-quality solutions.
