- Consider combining multiple local search operators like 2-opt, 3-opt, Or-opt, and Lin-Kernighan moves
- Try adaptive strategies that choose different operators based on problem size, tour quality, or search progress
- Implement multi-level approaches that apply different intensity of local search based on solution characteristics
- Consider probability-based selection of local search operators rather than deterministic size-based selection
- Try iterative improvement with different neighborhood structures (edge exchanges, node relocations, chain moves)
- Implement variable neighborhood search (VNS) that systematically changes neighborhood structures
- Consider incorporating problem-specific knowledge like nearest neighbor information or edge frequency analysis
- Try hybrid approaches combining deterministic hill climbing with randomized perturbations
- Implement adaptive step sizes or search intensities based on improvement patterns
- Consider using different termination criteria for local search based on solution quality or computation budget
